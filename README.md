# DriverPass Project - CS255

## Project Summary
The DriverPass project was designed to help users prepare for their driving tests by offering an easy-to-use, accessible platform. Users could take practice exams and schedule in-person driving practice sessions. The system was built as a web-based application, allowing it to function seamlessly across various devices without the need to create multiple platform-specific systems. The intended clients were individuals preparing to take their driving test, whether they were teenagers experiencing it for the first time or adults in need of a refresher.

## What I Did Well
One of the things I did particularly well on this project was understanding and interpreting the requirements. I was able to break down what was expected and translate those expectations into a clear system design. This helped me stay on track and make sure that all the features aligned with the client’s goals.

## What I Would Revise
If I had the chance to revise one part of my work, it would be the UML diagrams. While they served their purpose, I feel like I could improve both their visual clarity and the way they communicate the system’s structure. Cleaner formatting, better labeling, and clearer relationships between components would go a long way in making them easier to read and more effective for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Understanding and Implementing User Needs
While I don’t recall one specific user need that stood out, the overall approach to the project kept the user in mind from start to finish. The goal was to make something intuitive and helpful, especially for people who may be anxious or unfamiliar with the testing process. Considering the user’s needs is essential when designing a system because the success of any software depends on how well it serves the people who use it. If their goals aren’t met or the system isn’t easy to use, it doesn’t matter how “technically sound” the solution is.

## My Approach to Software Design
When it comes to designing software, I take things one step at a time. I break requirements into manageable pieces to make steady progress without getting overwhelmed. At the same time, I regularly step back and review the big picture to avoid getting tunnel vision on features that might not have a significant impact. In the future, I’d like to improve my use of design strategies such as wireframing, user story mapping, and possibly incorporate more advanced modeling techniques to better analyze and build effective systems.
